    "# List of all impulsePy commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: these commands use \"impulse\" as the name for the ImpulsePy library.\n",
    "To do this, use `import impulsePy as impulse`. Otherwise, replace the first part of the commands with impulsePy or the name that you chose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the commands, replace `<stimulus>` with one of the following options:\n",
    "- heat\n",
    "- bias\n",
    "- gas\n",
    "- liquid\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General commands\n",
    "`impulse.waitForControl()`\n",
    "> Monitors the status of Impulse, continues when the status is 'control'. This command makes sure that the rest of the code is only executed when Impulse is in control mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.getStatus()`\n",
    "> Returns the current status of Impulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.disconnect()`\n",
    "> Disconnect from Impulse. Prevents any issues when restarting a script or starting a different script.\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.<stimulus>.busy`\n",
    "> This is a variable that is either set to True or False. True means that a ramp or sweepcycle is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data request commands\n",
    "`impulse.<stimulus>.data.getLastData()`\n",
    "> Returns the last datapoint for the selected stimulus. This command is fast as it does not wait for a new datapoint to come in, but it will return the same datapoint multiple times if you call the command faster than that the hardware sends new measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.<stimulus>.data.getNewData()`\n",
    "> This command checks if the datapoint has already been requested, if so it will wait for Impulse to send a new datapoint. The script will wait for the new datapoint to be received.\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.<stimulus>.data.getDataFrame()`\n",
    "> The getDataFrame command can be used in a few different ways:\n",
    ">- __Without any arguments__, which will return all data for that stimulus that was collected from the start of the subscription.\n",
    ">- __With a single number or flag__, which will return all data from that row/flag onward. E.g. getDataFrame(-5) will return the last 5 rows.\n",
    ">- __With two numbers or flags__, which will return all rows from the first to the second number/flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.<stimulus>.data.setFlag(flagString)`\n",
    "> Set a flag for that data channel\n",
    ">- __flagString__, the flagstring should be a unique (not used before) string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Profile control commands\n",
    "`impulse.profile.load(path)`\n",
    "> Loads a profile into the profile player.\n",
    "> - __path__: needs to be an absolute path to the profile file. You can use `impulse.profilesPath+'profilename.extension'` if you want to load a profile directly from the profiles folder of Impulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.profile.control(action)`\n",
    "> Controls the profile playback buttons.\n",
    "> - __action__: \"play\", \"pause\", \"stop\"\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.profile.getStatus()`\n",
    "> Returns the status of the profile player: running, paused or stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heat control commands\n",
    "`impulse.heat.set(setpoint)`\n",
    "> This command lets you set the temperature to a setpoint as a direct step.\n",
    "> - __setpoint__: Temperature (°C)\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.heat.startRamp(target, rampSpeedType, rampSpeedValue)`\n",
    "> This command lets you start a temperature ramp from the current temperature to the target temperature. The second argument can either be \"rampTime\" or \"rampRate\" which determines what the value in the 3rd argument represents.\n",
    "> - __target__: Target temperature (°C)\n",
    "> - __rampSpeedType__: This argument should be \"rampTime\" or \"rampRate\", this determines what the next argument represents\n",
    "> - __rampSpeedValue__: This argument either sets the duration of the ramp (seconds), when rampTime is set in the previous argument, or the rampRate (°C/s) if rampRate is set in the previous argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.heat.stopRamp()`\n",
    "> This command lets you stop a running temperature ramp. This command has no arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bias control commands\n",
    "`impulse.bias.getConfguration()`\n",
    "> Returns a dictionary with the configurations of the biasing stimulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.bias.set(setpoint,compliance)`\n",
    "> This command directly sets the bias to the setpoint with the compliance setting given in the second argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.bias.startSweepCycle(baseline,amplitude,sweepCycleType, rate, cycles, compliance)`\n",
    "> This command lets you start a sweepcycle using the following arguments:\n",
    ">- __baseline__: sets the starting point of the cycle\n",
    ">- __amplitude__: sets the distance of the peaks relative to the baseline\n",
    ">- __sweepCycleType__: \"pulsating\" or \"alternating\", determines if the amplitude goes in both directions from the baseline (alternating) or only in a single direction (pulsating)\n",
    ">- __rate__: sets the rate of the cycle in V/min for voltage control or mA/min for current control or xxx/min for efield control\n",
    ">- __cycles__: sets the number of cycles for the sweep\n",
    ">- __compliance__: sets the compliance limit for the sweep\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.bias.stopSweepCycle()`\n",
    "> This command lets you stop a running sweepcycle\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gas control commands\n",
    "Some of the following commands and arguments are only applicable to Climate G+ systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "`impulse.gas.getConfguration()`\n",
    "> Returns a dictionary with the configurations of the gas stimulus.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "__G+:__ `impulse.gas.initiateFlow(reactorPressure, reactorFlow, gasConcentrationType, gas1Concentration, gas2Concentration)`\n",
    "> This command is only applicable to G+ systems. The arguments are identical to the setPF command. After initiateflow, the newly introduced gas will be flowing to the exhaust. To apply to reactor, the same setpoints have to be applied using the setPF command. For more information on the initiateFlow feature, read the Impulse manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "__G+:__ `impulse.gas.stopInitiateFlow()`\n",
